Website About OTI / NAF

● The Open Technology Institute formulates policy and regulatory reforms to 

support open architectures and open source innovations and facilitates the 

development and implementation of open technologies and communications 

networks. OTI promotes affordable, universal, and ubiquitous communications 

networks through partnerships with communities, researchers, industry, 

and public interest groups and is committed to maximizing the potentials of 

innovative open technologies by studying their social and economic impacts –

● The New America Foundation is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy institute 

that invests in new thinkers and new ideas to address the next generation of 

challenges facing the United States.

New America emphasizes work that is responsive to the changing conditions

transforming innovation and wealth creation, but also by shortened job tenures, 

longer life spans, mobile capital, financial imbalances and rising inequality.
